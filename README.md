# Washing-Machine

The project aims to design and implement a digital washing machine using Verilog HDL
and deploy it on an FPGA board. The system will operate with a clock frequency of 250
Hz and feature different wash modes, including Normal Wash, Quick Wash, Rinse, and
Spin. Each mode involves specific time durations for washing, rinsing, and spinning.
